        <b>Identification of Investigator and Purpose of Study</b><br>
        <p>You are invited to participate in a research study titled "Crowdsourced Content Moderation of Images". The study is being conducted by Brandon Dang, a graduate student in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, <a href='mailto:budang@utexas.edu'>budang@utexas.edu</a>, and Martin Riedl, a graduate student in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin <a href='mailto:martin.riedl@utexas.edu'>martin.riedl@utexas.edu</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Lease, an associate professor in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, 1616 Guadalupe Ste 5.202, Austin, TX 78701-1213, (512) 471-9350, <a href='mailto:ml@utexas.edu'>ml@utexas.edu</a>. This study has been reviewed by The University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board and the study number is 2018-01-0004.</p><br>

        <p>The purpose of this research study is to examine how to improve image moderation in social media settings, specifically, how a social media website, such as Facebook, may disallow posting of images which contain "adult content" (i.e., nudity or violence/gore) not suitable for a general audience. Your participation in the study will contribute to a better understanding of how people are able to discern and assess the content of images. You must be at least 18 years old to participate. The images you will see may be considered to be pornographic/graphic and thus offensive to some people. You should exercise caution when viewing the images and refrain from viewing them in any environment unsuitable for their content, such as libraries, schools, or other public locations where children or other potentially vulnerable populations may be found. Note that some states and countries have explicit laws regarding the viewing of obscene images in public, and viewing these images in a public space may be against the law. Due to the sensitive nature of the study, we recommend completing this task in private, such as in your own home.</p><br>

        <p>If you agree to participate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The activity will take approximately 10-15 minutes of your time.</li>
          <li>You will be asked to moderate images in order to identify ones depicting "adult content" (i.e., nudity or violence/gore) which should be flagged as containing objectionable content, vs. "safe" images suitable for a general audience. You will also answer a series of questions about how you feel about the images.</li>
          <li>You will be compensated $1.71 via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for your participation in this study.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <b>Risks/Benefits/Confidentiality of Data</b><br>
        <p>The risk that we are aware of is the potentially unpleasant and uncomfortable experience of viewing images containing "adult content." You will be exposed to content that may be considered disturbing in nature, and that includes images that explicitly display nudity, sex (e.g., sexual intercourse or genitals), gore, and depictions of violence.</p><br>

        <p>The imagery you will view consists of both <i>adult content</i> and <i>safe content</i>. There will be no costs for participating, nor will you benefit from participating beyond the financial compensation for your time. No identifying information about you (including name or email address) will be collected, so no one will be able to connect you to the research. Only the research team named above will have access to the data during data collection. MTurk worker IDs will not be shared with anyone outside of the research team, will be removed from the data set, and will not be linked to survey responses. Identifying information will be stripped from the final dataset. Worker IDs will only be collected in order to be able to distribute compensation.</p><br>

        <p><i>Disclaimer</i>: Any work performed on MTurk can be linked to users' public Amazon profile pages. Although we will anonymize your data, you may wish to restrict what information you choose to share on your public profile.</p><br>

        <b>Participation or Withdrawal</b><br>
        <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may <b>decline to answer any questionâ€‹</b> and you have the right to withdraw from participation at any time. Withdrawal will not affect your relationship with The University of Texas in any way. If you choose not to participate or to withdraw, please do not accept the Human Intelligence Task (HIT), or you may simply return it. Should you withdraw from the study, any data you have provided will not be used and will instead be discarded.</p><br>

        <b>Contacts</b><br>
        <p>If you have any questions about the study, please contact Martin Riedl at (512) 626 - 7822, <a href='mailto:martin.riedl@utexas.edu'>martin.riedl@utexas.edu</a>, or any or all of the other investigators at the above addresses and phone numbers to discuss the study. This study has been reviewed by The University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board and the study number is 2018-01-0004.</p><br>

        <b>Questions about your rights as a research participant.</b><br>
